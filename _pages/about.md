I am a computer science PhD candidate at [Colorado School of Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/) advised by [Prof. Mehmet Belviranlı](https://mehmet.belviranli.com/). Before joining Mines, I completed my BS in Computer Engineering at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) and received guidanced from [Prof. Levent Akın](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~akin/)

My research focuses on the field of diversely heterogeneous accelerators. Particularly, I've worked on increasing performance, energy efficiency, and utilization of heterogeneous systems for autonomous vehicles and drones. Throughout my research, I have quite worked on edge SoCs (NVIDIA Jetson Family, Qualcomm Development Kits, Raspberry PIs). I've also been working other system architecture related research topics, such as analytical modeling to predict the performance of heterogeneous systems, memory contention to minimize the performance degredation.

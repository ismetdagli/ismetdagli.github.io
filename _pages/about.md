I am a computer science PhD candidate at [Colorado School of Mines](https://cs.mines.edu/) advised by [Prof. Mehmet Belviranlı](https://mehmet.belviranli.com/). Before joining Mines, I completed my BS in Computer Engineering at [Boğaziçi University](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) and received guidanced from [Prof. Levent Akın](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~akin/)

My broader research interests span high performance and energy efficient heterogeneous execution, machine learning acceleration, autonomous computing, edge&cloud systems and systems security. Particularly, I've worked on increasing performance, energy efficiency, and utilization of heterogeneous edge systems for autonomous vehicles and drones. Throughout my research, I have quite worked on edge SoCs (NVIDIA Jetson Family, Qualcomm Development Kits, Raspberry PIs). I've also been working other system architecture related research topics, such as analytical and empirical performance modeling, resource contention (i.e., shared memory) to minimize the performance degredation and side&covert channel attacks over shared resources in system.

**I'm on the academic job market and/or research-oriented positions in industry.**
